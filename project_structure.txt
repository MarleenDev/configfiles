This is what your files should look like when you start if your project
is creatively called project, with a library called lib, and a executable
called app:

- project
  - .gitignore
  - README.md
  - LICENSE.md
  - CMakeLists.txt
  - cmake
    - FindSomeLib.cmake
    - something_else.cmake
  - include
    - project
      - lib.hpp
  - src
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - lib.cpp
  - apps
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - app.cpp
  - tests
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - testlib.cpp
  - docs
    - CMakeLists.txt
  - extern
    - googletest
  - scripts
    - helper.py
